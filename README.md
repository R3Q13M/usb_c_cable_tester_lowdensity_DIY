# USB Cable Tester

Simple board to test various USB cables!

Plug in your cable to both sides and see which signals light up!

**FOR CABLE USE ONLY. DO NOT EVER PLUG THIS IN TO A DEVICE, THE PINS ON ONE SIDE ARE ALL SHORTED TOGETHER AND THAT COULD BREAK IT!**

## Ordering Pre-made Boards From JLCPCB
I have added instructions on how to order from JLCPCB in the [ORDERING.md](ORDERING) page.

## Assembly
Want to build your own? Take a look at the release [here](https://github.com/alvarop/usb_c_cable_tester/releases/tag/v2.0). There's a file called jlcpcb.zip which you can use to order bare boards or fully assembled ones from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
